Here are 3 different Java Codes for calculating the Levenshtein Distance between 2 strings which is described here – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

    Code 1 – As is described in the above WIKI – follows the traditional Matrix based way of calculating the distance

    Code 2 – Using Recursive Dynamic Programming – starting to compare each character from the beginning of the String

    Code 3 – Same as Code 3 but uses – Java 7 – Fork and Join Pool to use threads to do the above calculation
